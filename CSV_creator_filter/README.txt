This part is to create and handle CSV files with TIMIT dataset.

You have to place your TIMIT directory here in CSV_creator_filter\

TIMIT_createCSV.py will simply create two CSV using the TIMIT arrangement, with all the possible information.
TIMIT_filterCSV.py will use the full CSV to create smaller CSV with less information according to your own chosen filters.
